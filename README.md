# Whriter
an easy use and material design style rich editor app with **NO MARKDOWN**

## What?

Rich editor app on mobile platform.
**Whriter** is the combination for word "White" and "Writer", means white writer.

## Why?

**People would use markdown in most of the mobile editor apps, but I think the moble platform is not suitable for markdown.**

1. You don't have the big full QWERTY keyboard for comfortable inputting; 
2. Phone's screen isn't big enough for previewing what you write.

So I made a toolbar for advanced input and format, just aim to make writing on mobile platform easier and more effcient.

## Preview

Here are some demo screenshot for Whriter, I'm still developing.
